<h1>Welcome to ikvjwd!</h1>
<h2>The symptom</h2>
<p>IPv6-only systems can't use GitHub.</p>
<pre>
$ git clone git@github.com:atom/atom.git
Cloning into 'atom'...
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Network is unreachable
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</pre>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>github.com is only accessible over IPv4.</p>
<pre>
$ host -t aaaa github.com
github.com has no AAAA record
</pre>
<h2>The right solution</h2>
<p>GitHub should be available over IPv6. Only GitHub can make that happen, so <a href="https://github.com/contact">contact them</a> if IPv6 is important to you.</p>
<h2>A workaround</h2>
<p>Just use ikvjwd.com instead of github.com.</p>
<pre>
$ git clone git@ikvjwd.com:atom/atom.git
Cloning into 'atom'...

remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.

<h2>More details</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> verify that you see the same SSH host key fingerprint from ikvjwd.com as you are seeing from github.com. Otherwise, we could be performing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><abbr title="Man-in-the-middle">MITM</abbr> attack</a> on you. We're not doing that, but you have no reason to trust us. So please <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-s-ssh-key-fingerprints">check</a>. Seriously.</p>
<h3>Why "ikvjwd"?</h3>
<p>GitHub only provides IPv4. This service provides IPv6. The difference is 2.</p>
<pre>
$ echo github | caesar 2
ikvjwd

<h2>Asked Questions</h2> <!-- not frequently, yet -->
<h3>How does ikvjwd work?</h3>
<p>It uses <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">haproxy</a>. The config file is <a href="https://github.com/rcsheets/ikvjwd/blob/master/haproxy.cfg">available on GitHub</a>. I'm not an haproxy expert. If I could be doing it better, please open an issue and/or submit a pull request.</p>
<h3>I get a "permission denied" error. What's going on?</h3>
<p>GitHub requires authentication for all SSH connections, so your git client must supply a private key that is associated with a GitHub account. If you don't present a key, or if your key is not associated with a GitHub account, you will receive a fairly unhelpful error message.</p>
